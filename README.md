# Personal-Finance-Tracker-project-
Personal Finance Tracker (WIP)
This is a simple web-based application designed to help users track their income, expenses, and overall balance. The app allows for basic user authentication (sign-up/login), secure password hashing, and filtering of transactions by week, month, or all time. A real-time Chart.js doughnut chart provides a clear visualization of spending patterns. Users can also export their transaction data as a CSV report.

Current Features:

User login & sign-up with SHA-256 password hashing.

Security question-based password reset.

Add, delete, and filter transactions (week/month/all time).

Real-time income vs. expense visualization using Chart.js.

CSV export for financial reports.

Fully client-side (LocalStorage for data persistence).

Status:
This project is a work in progress. Upcoming features include:

Monthly budgeting tools and advanced reporting.

Database integration for secure, multi-device access.

Modern UI improvements.
